<!--D3 demo: hardcoded bars removed, to be generated fr data-->
<!--
    Can yield a horizontal bar chart if properly bound to data
    (steelblue bars, white number overlays)
    ...but will yield only blank page at first.

<!--------------------------------
    Entering the following commands via console will
    incrementally re-create your hardcoded chart...

    //Init your data:
    var data = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42];

    //Select your chart.
    var chart = d3.select(".chart");

    //Prepare for data join.
    var bar = chart.selectAll("div");

    (this defines selection to which you will join data)

    //Join your data.
    var barUpdate = bar.data(data);

    //Instantiate new elements by appending to the “enter selection.”
    var barEnter = barUpdate.enter().append("div");

    //Set width of each bar proportional to its data value.
    barEnter.style("width", function(d) {
    return d * 10 + "px"; });

    //Label each bar.
    barEnter.text(function(d) { return d; });

<!--
Our Interpretation:
- data first creates a list of values
- then chart is selected for, d3.select(".chart") returns a prototype that selected the div with class="chart"
- then chart.selectAll("div") returns another prototype that selects all the divs within the given div with class="chart"
- barUpdate returns another prototype and binds each of the six values in data to the array
- The enter selection contains placeholders for all the divs
- .append("div") then adds a div to every placeholder
- Even though barEnter is an array of divs, you don't need a for loop to change each div's attributes separately as you
normally might with JavaScript. Instead you can just call barEnter. and whatever instructions you give reflects on all
the divs in the selection.
- for each value now in bar, a div is created and appended to the chart
- then all the divs are edited to reflect their new sizes
- finally, the inner HTML is modified to the inside of the divs
- The resulting bar graph looks just like the one for 00/index.html; going through d3 seems like it's just a more organized, and
less repetitive way to create a chart of divs and put values in each one (corresponding to its width). This would be especially
time-efficient if we had a lot of data because it would be difficult to write everything in the html individually as 00/index.html
does.

Questions:
- When we instantiate bar, the chart technically doesn't have any div elements inside. Does that make selectAll("div")
just a placeholder? I suppose bar automatically updates/calls to the latest version of chart, so even after you add new divs,
bar will reflect that and select all of them.
- What exactly is a Pt prototype?

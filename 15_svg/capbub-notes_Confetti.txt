1
 - When you click on a cell, an alert box pops up with the td's innerHTML

2
 - When you click on a cell, the cell content pops up first but then it
   traces itself back in the DOM so alerts happen in this fashion:
     td's innerHTML, tr's innerHTML, table's innerHTML

3
 - The true parameter in table.addEventListener makes that event listener
   happen first before any other event listeners beneath it in the DOM
   so the order becomes:
     table's innerHTML, td's innerHTML, tr's innerHTML
 - When the line is uncommented, only the table innerHTML will pop-up and not
  the trs or cell innerHTML since that's the first alert and propogation ends
  after it

4
 - The order in which the event listeners are attached does not matter
   because it's based on the DOM so it goes by:
     table's innerHTML, tr's innerHTML, td's innerHTML

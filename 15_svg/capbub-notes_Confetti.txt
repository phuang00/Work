1.
- When you click on a cell, an alert box pops up with the td's innerHTML

2.
- When you click on a cell, an alert box pops up with the cell content first, then traces back in the DOM
to the larger element containing it, so the alerts happen in this order: td's innerHTML, tr's innerHTML, and
then table's innerHTML

3.
- Similar to #2, but alerts happen in a different order. The true parameter in table.addEventListener makes that
event listener happen first before the other event listeners (td and tr) in the DOM. The order becomes table's innerHTML,
td's innerHTML, then tr's innerHTML.
- If the line e.stopPropagation() is uncommented, only the table innerHTML will pop up because it is the first alert and
the propagation ends after it so all the following event listeners are ignored.

4.
- The order in which the event listeners are attached doesn't matter because they all have the parameter true. Thus
the order of the alerts corresponds to how we traverse through the DOM, from the table's innerHTML, to tr's innerHTML,
then finally td's innerHTML.
- Uncommenting the line e.stopPropagation() will only allow the first alert, the table's innerHTML, to go through since
the other event listeners will be ignored.

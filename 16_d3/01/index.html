<!--D3 demo: hardcoded bars removed, to be generated fr data-->
<!--
    Can yield a horizontal bar chart if properly bound to data
    (steelblue bars, white number overlays)
    ...but will yield only blank page at first.

  .chart div {
  font: 10px sans-serif;
  background-color: steelblue;
  text-align: right;
  padding: 3px;
  margin: 1px;
  color: white;

<!--------------------------------
    Entering the following commands via console will
    incrementally re-create your hardcoded chart...

    //Init your data:
    var data = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42];

    //Select your chart.
    var chart = d3.select(".chart");

    //Prepare for data join.
    var bar = chart.selectAll("div");

    (this defines selection to which you will join data)

    //Join your data.
    var barUpdate = bar.data(data);

    //Instantiate new elements by appending to the “enter selection.”

    var barEnter = barUpdate.enter().append("div");

    //Set width of each bar proportional to its data value.
    barEnter.style("width", function(d) {
    return d * 10 + "px"; });

    //Label each bar.
    barEnter.text(function(d) { return d; });
  -------------------------------->

  <!-- Notes:
  - When we instantiate bar, the chart technically doesn't have any div elements inside. Does that make selectAll("div")
  just a placeholder? I suppose bar automatically updates/calls to the latest version of chart, so even after you add new divs,
  bar will reflect that and select all of them.
  - What does enter() do? It seems like barUpdate joins the data to the chart, while barEnter actually enters each data value
  to its own div, which is newly instantiated for each value.
  - The enter selection contains placeholders for all the divs
  - .append("div") then adds a div to every placeholder
  - Even though barEnter is an array of divs, you don't need a for loop to change each div's attributes separately as you
  normally might with JavaScript. Instead you can just call barEnter. and whatever instructions you give reflects on all
  the divs in the selection.
  - The resulting bar graph looks just like the one for 00/index.html; going through d3 seems like it's just a more organized, and
  less repetitive way to create a chart of divs and put values in each one (corresponding to its width). This would be especially
  time-efficient if we had a lot of data because it would be difficult to write everything in the html individually as 00/index.html
  does.
  - When inputting these commands via the console, all of them return undefined, except for barEnter.style and barEnter.text which
  return Pt containing the data array and having the "chart" div as the parents. What does Pt stand for? What is a Pt prototype? -->
